# ONI_file_player
Simple player for ONI  files.  
GUI made by PyQT5 library.  
For oni file processing openni2 python wrapper library was used.

Tasks:  
- open oni file by standard file dialog
- show color and depth video from oni file (synchronously)  
- pause and restart video
- jump to arbitrary frame by slider
- switch frame by frame in pause mode

Work in progress. Some problems are in video synchronization.
